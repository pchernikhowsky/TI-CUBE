# The TI CUBE

The `TI CUBE` is a homebrew microcomputer I designed based on the Texas Instruments TMS9900 microprocessor and its associated peripherals.

In its basic form the `TI CUBE` supports serial communications, 32KB of RAM and 32KB of ROM.

## Why the TMS9900?

The [TMS9900 microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMS9900) was relatively advanced for its time (released in 1976) and is essentially a single-chip version of TI's 990 series of 16-bit minicomputers from the 1970s. The TMS9900 is considered one of the first true 16-bit microprocessors with a full 16-bit external data bus. This was allowed by the use of rather unconventional 64-pin DIP package. The address bus uses 15 bits, but since all memory accesses are 16-bits wide, this provides a 64KB address space (32K of 16 bit words). The most unique feature of the TMS990 is that it had no internal registers, other than PC (program counter), WP (workspace pointer), and status register (SR) - all 16-bits wide. Instead of internal registers, the WP pointed to a region in external memory where 16 "registers" were stored in sequential memory addresses. Adjusting the WP allowed for very fast context switching by pointing to a different set of "registers". This capability was used in the TMS/990 minicomputers to support multiuser computing.

The elegance of the 16-bit bus and the memory-based registers makes this chip a fascinating way to explore early microcomputer technology and its capabilities.

## Design Philosophy

The following principles guided my development of this homebrew project. The list is roughly in order of priority (highest is first).

1. **No 8-bit data buses!** The TMS9900 microprocessor is fundamentally a 16-bit design descendent from TI's 990 series of 16-bit minicomputers and I wanted to honour this ancestry as much as possible. I find address/data bus muxing/demuxing unsightly, complex, and inelegant. Yes, the TMS9900 isn't the fastest of the TMS99XX series of microprocessors, but it's the only one that supports a pure 16-bit data bus interface.

2. **Modularity.** Just like a minicomputer which would typically have a backplane populated with multiple cards, the `TI CUBE` uses a similar philosophy with three basic cards: 
   * CPU card (with clock and interrupt control)
   * Memory card (holding the RAM and ROM)
   * Serial port interface card (equipped with two serial chips driving two EIA-232C compatible ports). 
  
   All cards plug into a backplane using 72 pin header connectors. Any card can go in any slot, and multiple cards (e.g., multiple seial interface cards) are supported. Additional backplanes can also be daisy-chained to support additional card slots.

3. **Board size.** Constraining the board size to 100 x 100 mm (4 x 4 in) allows ordering PCBs using the [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) or [PCBWAY](https://pcbway.com) prototyping services (personally, I have had great experience with JLCPCB). This significantly reduces the cost of individual boards (approximately $2 per board). The physical construction also gives the `TI CUBE` its name: four 100 x 100 mm cards plugged into a four-slot 100 x 100 mm backplane.

4. **Simplicity.** I subscribe to the [Earl Muntz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muntzing) philosophy. As such, the `TI CUBE` design uses the minimum required amount of components to accomplish its function. Random logic (i.e., TTL gates and decoders) is complex and consumes significant board space. Instead, I prefer to use simple and standard PLD devices like the ubiquitous 16V8, which does everything needed in one chip. This also allows easily reconfigurability simply by reprogramming the PLD. There are  no address or data buffers in the `TI CUBE`, but the small size combined with the use of four-layer PCBs keeps the digital signals clean; my builds have demonstrated excellent reliablity and performance. 

5. **Compatibility.** I designed the `TI CUBE` to be compatible with other TMS9900-based systems. One popular example is [Stuart Connor's TMS9900 breadboard/PCB system](http://www.stuartconner.me.uk/tms9900_breadboard/tms9900_breadboard.htm). In fact, the binary files he provides can be downloaded, burned to EPROMs, and used directly in the `TI CUBE`.

# Notes

[^1] A 48 MHz crystal is required for the TIM9904 and a 12 MHz crystal is required for the TIM9904A(NL). The LC tank circuit values must also be adjusted as per the notes on the CPU board schematic.

[^2] The RAM and ROM sizes can be adjusted in any combination that fits within the 64KB address space simply by adjusting the logic for the chip enable outputs in the PLD program.
